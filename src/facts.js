        "The field of AI is considered to have its origin in 1950, with publication of British mathematician Alan Turing's paper, Computing Machinery and Intelligence.",
        "The term, Artificial Intelligence, was coined in 1956 by mathematician and computer scientist John McCarthy, at Dartmouth College, in New Hampshire.",
        "In 1997, a chess-playing program named Deep Blue, developed by IBM, beat the reigning world chess champion.",
        "A so-called AI Winter occurred in 1974, when funding was cut after Speech Understanding research did not live up to its promise.",
        "A driverless robotic car named Stanley, engineered by Sebastian Thrun's Stanford Racing team, sped through the Mojave desert at 22 miles per hour to win the 2005 Darpa Grand Challenge.",
        "In 1951, using the Ferranti Mark 1 machine of the University of Manchester, Christopher Strachey wrote a checkers program and Dietrich Prinz wrote one for chess.Arthur Samuel's checkers program, developed in the middle 50s and early 60s, eventually achieved sufficient skill to challenge a respectable amateur.",
        "In 1955, Allen Newell and (future Nobel Laureate) Herbert A. Simon created the 'Logic Theorist' (with help from J. C. Shaw). The program would eventually prove 38 of the first 52 theorems in Russell and Whitehead's Principia Mathematica, and find new and more elegant proofs for some.",

        "In Japan, Waseda University initiated the WABOT project in 1967, and in 1972 completed the WABOT-1, the world's first full-scale intelligent humanoid robot, or android.",
        "In 1972 Richard Karp showed there are many problems that can probably only be solved in exponential time (in the size of the inputs).",
        "In 1973, the Lighthill report on the state of AI research in England criticized the utter failure of AI to achieve its 'grandiose objectives' and led to the dismantling of AI research in that country.",
        "In 1980, an expert system called XCON was completed at CMU for the Digital Equipment Corporation.",
        "In 1981, the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry set aside $850 million for the Fifth generation computer project."
